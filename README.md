This is a work in progress to summarize vote totals for all American
presidential elections from 1828 to now.  The format is somewhat _ad
hoc_, basically CSV with comments.  This repo was created for use with
the [PEC demonstration code](https://github.com/galenhuntington/pec),
and this is reflected in the structure and the data included.

Each row lists a state, its number of electoral votes, and the vote
totals for each candidate.  Most elections feature huge numbers of
candidates, and I do not attempt to list them all, but I included
those needed to calculate results for PEC as described [in my
paper](https://galen.xyz/electoral/).

In past elections, some electoral slates were chosen by legislature
rather than popular vote; in those cases, I have given the chosen
candidate 1 and the others 0.  In a few elections, some electors were
unpledged or only tied to a party, and this is noted.
